# Anushka's First CS193 Homework

List of my favourite things about CS193:
- We get to learn about some awesome tools in CS that will help us do personal projects easily!
- We have great instructors that explain the content and homework in an easy manner.
- At the end of this course I will be able to show off my cool work using the CS tools to my non-CS friends :D
